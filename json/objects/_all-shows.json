The family of nine strives to be self-sufficient against all odds- often shunning modern society to live off the wilderness and to walk where no man has ever walked before. After the tragic death of his parents and sister that left him orphaned at 16, Billy Brown vowed to live life on his own terms and create his own family to reclaim the love that he lost. With Ami by his side, Billy traveled the lower 48 states and eventually found home in the sprawling landscape of the last frontier, where they have spent most of the last 30 years raising their children. \"Our family is doing what is natural for human beings to do. We survive on what we hunt, fish, trap and barter for,\" Brown says. \"We explore, we wander, we live. If you think about it, it's the life we were meant to live.\"",

There's Roger, the sarcastic space alien who rescued Stan from Area 51 who deeply resents the fact that he's not allowed to leave the house, and therefore, has been reduced to drinking wine and smoking cigarettes, and Klaus, a lascivious, German-speaking goldfish; the result of a CIA experiment gone seriously wrong where the CIA tried to give a fish a German man's brain. Stan's son is a dorky teenager who tries to be cool. His wife has had a past life of sex and drugs.",

Cautioned by Amy not tell anyone about her, Allison can't discuss this over-the-top oddball with her father and business partner, Marv, a sunburned dermatologist who shares an office with Allison, or her younger brother, Brad, a pharmaceutical sales rep who lives in a guest room over her garage. As Allison tries to push Amy away, Amy makes her final pitch: her sole mission is to provide Allison with helpful guidance that nudges her in the right direction in life - and it's her final chance to prove herself as an angel. With that, Allison agrees to this unlikely relationship because maybe a weird friend is exactly what she needs... and what if Amy really is her \"guardian angel\"?",

They move into their last remaining asset - the model home left over from their latest housing tract. Their luxury vehicles are replaced with a reminder of the family's former wealth - the stair car that accompanied their private jet. The patriarch of the family is George Bluth - he's now in prison, and loving every minute of it. His wife Lucille and daughter Lindsay are spoiled socialites who can't handle getting kicked out of family restaurants. His son Buster is in his mid 30's and lives at home. His son George Oscar Bluth is a magician who started a group to get magicians to be taken seriously - and gets kicked out when his own tricks are revealed. Lindsay is married to a man named Tobias Funke, once a psychiatrist, who decides to become an actor. The only sane member of the family - Michael Bluth, along with his son George Michael, want nothing to do with the family business. But one bizarre circumstance after another keeps Michael and George Michael from leaving their eccentric family.",

A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest of titans. Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a titan in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a colossal titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder every single titan and take revenge for all of mankind.",

            "Plot": "A metropolis in turmoil. From economy to culture, politics to the underworld - everything is in the grip of radical change. Speculation and inflation are already tearing away at the foundations of the still young Weimar Republic. Growing poverty and unemployment stand in stark contrast to the excesses and indulgence of the city's night life and its overflowing creative energy. Gereon Rath, a young police inspector from Cologne, is transferred to Berlin in order to solve a criminal case - a porno ring run by the Berlin Mafia. What at first glance appears to be simply a matter of extortion soon reveals itself to be a scandal that will forever change the lives of both Gereon and his closest associates. Together with stenotypist Charlotte Ritter and his partner Bruno Wolter, Rath is confronted with a tangled web of corruption, drug dealing, and weapons trafficking, forcing him into an existential conflict as he is torn between loyalty and uncovering the truth. And we are left wondering: in this story, who is friend and who is foe? With the political unrest spurred by May Day demonstrations and rising National Socialism, even an institution like the \"Rote Burg,\" Berlin's police headquarters and the center of democracy and the constitutional state, is increasingly becoming the melting pot of a democracy whose days are numbered.",

Thirteen of those house guests live in 13 different states. America will watch every single move they compete to be the last one standing, after having twelve house guests evicted.

It's the first time they will get to know each other and they're not allowed to say not one word with them until they are in the Big Brother house. The thirteen will be living in the same house for the following two months. They may either find their best friend or worst enemy in that group; and in the end, it's one men for themselves. Then, contestants who have performed their stunts were asked to vote for the person who should be kicked out of the house (which happens to be the loser), and the guest with the most votes, is the loser and will be evicted from the Big Brother household. However, if the participant wins his/her stunts, then the player will be named \"Head of the Household,\" for a day. The guest who stays in the house longer than anybody else does wins $500,000.",

Regardless of her being the focus for many in town, Olivia's life has not been issue-free, she long ago having gone through a divorce from her physician ex-husband, the dissolution of their marriage largely due to the accidental drowning death of their son, Jordan, when he was thirteen, that incident from which they as a couple could not recover. Also affected was Jordan's twin sister, Justine, now a young woman, who has been struggling to find her place in life ever since. Much like the town is being pulled in different directions, such as by cutthroat developer Warren Saget, Olivia is often pulled in different directions, personally and professionally, which one day make take her away from Cedar Cove. In the former category is her search for love. Through it all, she acts as supporter and supportee to her friends and family, including librarian Grace Sherman, her best friend since they were children.",

He's middle-aged, his wife wants a divorce, which might put a strain on his relationship with his astute teenage daughter he deeply cares about, and he's getting tired of his professional work. Chance's natural talent for psychoanalysis allows him to easily assess everyone that wants his help but that doesn't mean he can actually cure them or even help them. Everything changes however, when he meets mysterious and attractive Jaclyn Blackstone, who turns out to have both dark secrets and big psychological as well as private problems. But her most immediate problem is her abusive ex-husband Raymond Blackstone, who also happens to be a corrupt cop with connections. Chance falls for Jaclyn and becomes obsessed with helping her but he quickly realizes that he's in over his head. Help eventually comes in the form of a hulking man called D. While clearly a bit unhinged, asocial and disturbed, D is also highly skilled, calculated, smart and efficient and possesses huge knowledge of tactics, weaponry and hand-to-hand combat. He is also highly focused and loyal and agrees to help Chance find a way to deal with the new and dangerous situation he's put himself in over Jaclyn.",

But she has always suffered from anxiety and depression, for which she is on a plethora of pills. Those maladies are largely from being pushed by her overbearing Jewish mother, which also led to Rebecca's father abandoning the family when she was young. When on the streets of New York Rebecca runs into Josh Chan, her boyfriend from summer camp ten years ago when they were sixteen, she remembers back to that time as the happiest time in her life, happiness which eludes her. When Josh mentions that he is imminently moving back to his hometown of West Covina, California, Rebecca decides to pursue happiness in moving to West Covina herself, telling people it's because she got a fabulous job there, where in reality it's to rekindle a relationship with Josh, which she believes is what will make her happy. As Rebecca ekes out a life in West Covina with a wide array of new friends, colleagues, allies and enemies - within this collection being Josh and his friends - Rebecca may come to some realizations about her life and what she is trying to achieve. Does this all make her a crazy ex-girlfriend, or is it a little more nuanced than that?",

Called in by local police departments to assist in solving crimes of a serial and/or extremely violent nature where the perpetrator is unknown (referred to by the Unit as the unknown subject or unsub for short), the BAU uses the controversial scientific art of profiling to track and apprehend the unsub. Profiling entails coming up with basic characteristics of the unsub and the victims (referred to as the victimology), using evidence from the case and matching that information to historic precedents and psychological analyses as a means to solve the case. Because of the nature of the work conducted by the BAU - the work being time consuming and psychologically demanding - its members are fiercely loyal to the Unit and to its other members. Also because of the work's overall demanding nature, not many members of the BAU have been able to maintain a happy or stable family life.",

His reasons for leaving London and the high-paid life of a consultant are not clear initially but related to a phobia he has recently developed. He soon meets several of the locals and eccentricity abounds. Martin's situation is made more difficult by what can only be referred as an almost complete lack of an acceptable bedside manner. He is gruff, abrupt and intolerant, not only in issues related to medicine, but to life in general. He and the headmistress of the local school, Louisa Glasson, are clearly attracted to each other and despite their awkwardness, slowly develop a relationship.",

To solve the problem, Hiccup's father, Stoick the Vast, organizes the Berk Dragon Academy where his son and friends can learn all about Dragons.

Together, with their drastically different backgrounds, the pair are dropped into scenarios that could happen to anyone: marooned sailors, lost hikers, trapped divers and stranded mountain climbers.

Once considered to be the state's very own \"Sin City,\" McCarthy is now an isolated town - a refuge for people who don't want to be found that's surrounded by extreme wilderness. While some believe in continuing the town's frontier way of life, others feel the future of McCarthy depends on dragging itself into the modern age. Which way of life will reign supreme? It's tradition versus transformation. Built during the Gold Rush in 1900, McCarthy was once a vibrant and flourishing city. Today, with over 100 miles between the residents and the nearest law enforcement, only 42 people still brave the extreme conditions to live in this secluded, 'Old West' town. A place where young men go to prove themselves, and old outlaws go to die; home to bear hunters, gold miners, gun smiths, backwoods survivalists - those who choose to reside in this little known town are willing to risk their lives to live truly free. Each of the roughly four dozen residents of McCarthy is living this dangerous wilderness life for their own, very different, reasons. Neil Darish moved to McCarthy with dreams of restoring the small town to its former glory. After spending years buying property after property in downtown McCarthy, he plans to bring this frontier town into the 21st Century. On the opposite end of the spectrum are long-standing residents like Jeremy Keller who came to McCarthy hoping to escape the evils of modern day society, and will fight to protect 'the old way' at any cost. As diverse as the citizens of McCarthy are, they have one thing in common: everyone who ventures to this town is trying to run away from something. They are mavericks and trailblazers, risk takers and rabble rousers, all attempting to escape their past by surviving at the end of America. This is the story of our country's last true frontier town - on the Edge of Alaska.",

While with the Oxford City Police, Morse is taken under the wing of veteran Detective Inspector Fred Thursday.

Thursday and Morse's fellow officer, Police Constable Strange, try to steer the young Endeavour into taking his Sergeant's exam, so that he may be relieved of \"General Duties\" and become Thursday's official \"bag man\" with the appropriate rank and title.",

After making the Lincolns a lucrative offer, they pack up and ship out to the States. It doesn't take long for them to figure out that Hollywood is a place where deals are made and broken in the same breath. They soon find themselves holding on tight as creative control of their show starts to slip away from their hands. Merc ultimately dismisses the original star, an elder, distinguished, gentleman, for 'Friends' actor 'Matt LeBlanc', a charming, yet manipulative beast, with a grocery list of demands. Hollywood is not what the Lincolns had in mind, but Sean believes he can swim with the sharks. As for Beverly, she'd rather go back to the UK than deal with these Episodes.",

            "Plot": "The all new \"true crime\" case of Fargo's new chapter travels back to 1979 in Sioux Falls, South Dakota and Luverne, Minnesota, where a young State Police Officer Lou Solverson, recently back from Vietnam, investigates a case involving a local crime gang and a major Mob syndicate. Helping him piece things together is his father-in-law, Sheriff Hank Larsson. The investigation will lead them to a colorful cast of characters that includes Karl Weathers, the town lawyer of Luverne, Minnesota. A Korean War vet, Karl is a flowery drunk blessed with the gift of gab and the eloquence of a true con artist. Joe Bulo, the front man for the northern expansion of a Kansas City crime syndicate. The new face of corporate crime, Joe's bringing a Walmart mentality to small town America. His number two is Mike Milligan. Part enforcer, part detective, Mike is always smiling - but the joke is usually on you. Bulo and his crew have their sights set on the Gerhardt crime family in Fargo, currently led by matriarch Floyd Gerhardt. With her husband at death's door, Floyd takes over the family business, frustrating her eldest son, Dodd Gerhardt. An impatient hothead with a cruel streak to match his ambitions, Dodd can't wait for both his parents to die so he can take over and expand their business from kingdom to empire. Bear Gerhardt is the middle son, an intimidatingly large man who, although inarticulate, is the most decent of his clan. Rye Gerhardt, the youngest of the Gerhardt clan, views himself as a big shot, but in reality he's just a small dog who barks big.",

Thus begins Gordon's lonely quest that would set him against his own comrades and the underworld with their own deadly rivalries and mysteries. In the coming wars, innocence will be lost and compromises will be made as some criminals will fall as casualties while others will rise as supervillains. All the while, young Bruce observes this war with a growing obsession that would one day drive him to seek his own justice against the evil of Gotham as The Batman.",

Pushed into the dangerous world of lies, betrayal and murder, Sidney quickly finds that his insight into the human condition, and the natural trust that he engenders in people, means that he excels in his new position as 'detective'. Joining Sidney as he journeys into this dark world is the affable but world-weary Detective Inspector Geordie Keating, the naive, but well-meaning curate Leonard Finch, and his austere and constantly disapproving housekeeper Mrs Maguire. But crime isn't the only matter that occupies Sidney. He's smitten with the witty, beautiful, Amanda, but could high society Amanda ever be allowed to marry a lowly country vicar? Can you still see the best in people when the world of murder asks you to see the worst?",

It's the summer of 1932. India dreams of Independence, but the British are clinging to power. In the foothills of the Himalayas stands Simla; a little England where every summer the British power-brokers of this nation are posted to govern during the summer months.",

The biological father is a married man named Rafeal Solano, who is a cancer survivor and a former playboy. He is the new owner of the hotel where Jane works, and was her former teenage crush. Petra, Rafael's amoral and scheming wife, learns of the mistake and plots her own agenda. Petra is also involved in an affair with Roman Zazo, Rafael's best friend, who is under investigation by Jane's police detective boyfriend, Michael, and who also deals with Jane's unexpected condition in his own way. Meanwhile, the doctor who inseminated Jane, Dr. Luisa Alver, who is Rafael's younger sister, is distraught over learning that her wife cheated on her and left her. Elsewhere, Rogelio de la Vega, a famous TV star and, unbeknownst to her, Jane's biological father, shows up to wanting to make contact with Xiomara, unaware of Jane's existence.",

            "Plot": "On the heels of the syndicated success of \"Wheel of Fortune (1983)\", producer Merv Griffin decided to return his classic quiz show-with-a-twist, \"Jeopardy!\" to the airwaves in 1984. It, too, was a huge success, and also marked a return to the game's tried-and-true formula of answers and questions (after a slightly-modified remake six years earlier failed to catch on). Three contestants, including a returning champion, competed. Six categories are announced (e.g., Art World, Cooking, 20th Century Republicans, \"Friends (1994)\", Muscle Men and College Girls Wearing White T-shirts), each having five answers ostensibly graded by difficulty, from $100 to $500. The champion chose a category and dollar amount (e.g., \"College Girls Wearing White T-shirts for $100\"), to which host Trebek reads the answer (\"Inspector 12 must give her seal of approval before a college girl can wear one of these plain white T-shirts\"). Contestants had to respond in question form (\"What is Hanes?\") ; if correct, they won the value of the question; if he/she was incorrect, failed to answer in time or phrase in the form of a question, that amount was deducted (hence, the dollar amount was \"always in jeopardy\") and his/her opponents could answer; having enough incorrect answers often led to negative scores. Thereafter, the contestant providing the last correct question selected next, and the process repeated; some answers made use of audio and/or video clues. Hidden behind one of the answers was a \"Daily Double\" space, with the contestant selecting that space able to wager up to all his/her current winnings or up to $500 if he/she had less) on the answer. After all 30 answers have been revealed (or sometimes, an undefined time limit expired), the game moved into \"Double Jeopardy!\" Gameplay was the same in \"Double Jeopardy!\" except six new categories were announced and the answers had values of $200 to $1,000 and two \"Daily Double\" spaces were hidden (with contestants able to wager up to $1,000 if they had less). At the end of the \"Double Jeopardy!\" round, all contestants with at least $1 were eligible to play \"Final Jeopardy!\"; however, anyone with $0 or a negative score was disqualified from further play. Trebek announced a category, and the contestants (before seeing the answer) wagered up to everything they had on their ability to answer. Contestants had 30 seconds to write what they believed was the correct question. Those who were correct had the amount they wagered added to their winnings; however, any incorrect questions or failing to phrase properly lost what they wagered. The contestant with the most cash was champion, kept his/her winnings and got to return the next day. Champions competed until they won five shows (at which point they retired undefeated and, starting in 1997, also won a new car) or until they were defeated. All five-time champions and other high-scoring contestants over a period of time participated in a Tournament of Champions, the winner earning an additional $100,000; there were also teen, college, senior and international tournaments and celebrity shows conducted (the winners of the non-celebrity tournaments also earned a spot in the Tournament of Champions). In the fall of 2001, several changes were made, including the use of a \"Clue Crew\" (new regulars illustrating answers in selected categories by going \"on location\"), and an increase in the dollar values of the answers (from $200 to $1,000 in Jeopardy! and $400 to $2,000 in Double Jeopardy!) ; another running change through the years was the addition of \"celebrity guests\" reading certain answers. None of the changes altered the basic game play, however.",

Diagnosed as schizophrenic as a child, David has been in and out of psychiatric hospitals for years. Now in his early 20's and free once again, David loses himself in the rhythm of the structured regimen of daily life: breakfast, lunch, dinner, therapy, medications, sleep. David spends the rest of his time in companionable silence alongside his chatterbox friend Lenny (Aubrey Plaza), a fellow patient whose life-long drug and alcohol addiction has done nothing to quell her boundless optimism that her luck is about to change. The pleasant numbness of David's routine is completely upended with the arrival of a beautiful and troubled new patient named Syd (Rachel Keller). Inexplicably drawn to one another, David and Syd share a startling encounter, after which David must confront the shocking possibility that the voices he hears and the visions he sees may actually be real.",

At the same time, the enigmatic Monsieur Madeleine, who is secretly the ex-convict Jean Valjean, is trying to live an honest life as the beneficent mayor of the same town Fantine works in. Both Valjean and Cosette's lives drastically change as the Thénardiers show their true colors and Inspector Javert arrives in town, posing a potential threat to Madeleine's freedom. This adaptation follows Hugo's story with relative faithfulness, given its young audience, limited running time and moments of artistic license.",

To set matters right, Dan enlists the help of Chris, a brilliant, polished and popular history professor at the college, who's now given the incredible opportunity to actually live the history he teaches.",

This team of elite agents, based in Washington, D.C., solve criminal cases involving Marine and Navy personnel and their families, sometimes traveling the United States - or the world - to do it.",

But when she's reunited with Henry - the son she gave up for adoption ten years ago - on the night of her 28th birthday, everything changes. The now 10-year-old Henry is in desperate need of Emma's help because he believes from reading a book of fairytales that she's the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming - who sent her away from the Enchanted Forest to be protected from a curse that was enacted by the Evil Queen. Emma initially refuses to believe a word of Henry's story but soon finds that his hometown of Storybrooke, Maine is more than it seems. Because it's in Storybrooke that all of the classic characters we know are frozen in time with no memories of their former selves - except for the Evil Queen, who is Storybrooke's mayor and Henry's adoptive mother Regina Mills. Now, as the epic \"Final Battle\" for the future of both worlds approaches, Emma will have to accept her destiny and uncover the mystery behind a place where fairytales are to be believed.",

To prevent Iran from going nuclear, he has assumed a fake persona as an average businessman when in reality he is actually a highly skilled intelligence officer, who took the piping job because of the routine business trips to Luxembourg, and because the job is secluded and too dull to be noticed. Unfortunately for him a European cop is at his heels trying to discover who he is, his incessantly grim and nervous coworker Mr. Icabod has figured out that he isn't who he says, and Steven, a chubby employee with a recent brain injury, is starting to remember a horrible act which John may have inflicted.",
