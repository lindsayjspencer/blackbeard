From economy to culture, politics to the underworld - everything is in the grip of radical change. Speculation and inflation are already tearing away at the foundations of the still young Weimar Republic. Growing poverty and unemployment stand in stark contrast to the excesses and indulgence of the city's night life and its overflowing creative energy. Gereon Rath, a young police inspector from Cologne, is transferred to Berlin in order to solve a criminal case - a porno ring run by the Berlin Mafia. What at first glance appears to be simply a matter of extortion soon reveals itself to be a scandal that will forever change the lives of both Gereon and his closest associates.

But her most immediate problem is her abusive ex-husband Raymond Blackstone, who also happens to be a corrupt cop with connections. Chance falls for Jaclyn and becomes obsessed with helping her but he quickly realizes that he's in over his head. Help eventually comes in the form of a hulking man called D. While clearly a bit unhinged, asocial and disturbed, D is also highly skilled, calculated, smart and efficient and possesses huge knowledge of tactics, weaponry and hand-to-hand combat.

When on the streets of New York Rebecca runs into Josh Chan, her boyfriend from summer camp ten years ago when they were sixteen, she remembers back to that time as the happiest time in her life, happiness which eludes her. When Josh mentions that he is imminently moving back to his hometown of West Covina, California, Rebecca decides to pursue happiness in moving to West Covina herself, telling people it's because she got a fabulous job there, where in reality it's to rekindle a relationship with Josh, which she believes is what will make her happy. As Rebecca ekes out a life in West Covina with a wide array of new friends, colleagues, allies and enemies - within this collection being Josh and his friends - Rebecca may come to some realizations about her life and what she is trying to achieve.

Profiling entails coming up with basic characteristics of the unsub and the victims (referred to as the victimology), using evidence from the case and matching that information to historic precedents and psychological analyses as a means to solve the case. Because of the nature of the work conducted by the BAU - the work being time consuming and psychologically demanding - its members are fiercely loyal to the Unit and to its other members.

Once considered to be the state's very own \"Sin City,\" McCarthy is now an isolated town - a refuge for people who don't want to be found that's surrounded by extreme wilderness. While some believe in continuing the town's frontier way of life, others feel the future of McCarthy depends on dragging itself into the modern age. Which way of life will reign supreme? It's tradition versus transformation. Built during the Gold Rush in 1900, McCarthy was once a vibrant and flourishing city. Today, with over 100 miles between the residents and the nearest law enforcement, only 42 people still brave the extreme conditions to live in this secluded, 'Old West' town. A place where young men go to prove themselves, and old outlaws go to die; home to bear hunters, gold miners, gun smiths, backwoods survivalists - those who choose to reside in this little known town are willing to risk their lives to live truly free. Each of the roughly four dozen residents of McCarthy is living this dangerous wilderness life for their own, very different, reasons. Neil Darish moved to McCarthy with dreams of restoring the small town to its former glory. After spending years buying property after property in downtown McCarthy, he plans to bring this frontier town into the 21st Century. On the opposite end of the spectrum are long-standing residents like Jeremy Keller who came to McCarthy hoping to escape the evils of modern day society, and will fight to protect 'the old way' at any cost. As diverse as the citizens of McCarthy are, they have one thing in common: everyone who ventures to this town is trying to run away from something. They are mavericks and trailblazers, risk takers and rabble rousers, all attempting to escape their past by surviving at the end of America.

The investigation will lead them to a colorful cast of characters that includes Karl Weathers, the town lawyer of Luverne, Minnesota. A Korean War vet, Karl is a flowery drunk blessed with the gift of gab and the eloquence of a true con artist. Joe Bulo, the front man for the northern expansion of a Kansas City crime syndicate. The new face of corporate crime, Joe's bringing a Walmart mentality to small town America. His number two is Mike Milligan. Part enforcer, part detective, Mike is always smiling - but the joke is usually on you. Bulo and his crew have their sights set on the Gerhardt crime family in Fargo, currently led by matriarch Floyd Gerhardt. With her husband at death's door, Floyd takes over the family business, frustrating her eldest son, Dodd Gerhardt. An impatient hothead with a cruel streak to match his ambitions, Dodd can't wait for both his parents to die so he can take over and expand their business from kingdom to empire. Bear Gerhardt is the middle son, an intimidatingly large man who, although inarticulate, is the most decent of his clan. Rye Gerhardt, the youngest of the Gerhardt clan, views himself as a big shot, but in reality he's just a small dog who barks big.","Language":"English, German, Korean, Spanish, American Sign Language, French, Russian, Hebrew","Country":"USA","Awards":"Won 3 Golden Globes.

It, too, was a huge success, and also marked a return to the game's tried-and-true formula of answers and questions (after a slightly-modified remake six years earlier failed to catch on). Three contestants, including a returning champion, competed. Six categories are announced (e.g., Art World, Cooking, 20th Century Republicans, \"Friends (1994)\", Muscle Men and College Girls Wearing White T-shirts), each having five answers ostensibly graded by difficulty, from $100 to $500. The champion chose a category and dollar amount (e.g., \"College Girls Wearing White T-shirts for $100\"), to which host Trebek reads the answer (\"Inspector 12 must give her seal of approval before a college girl can wear one of these plain white T-shirts\"). Contestants had to respond in question form (\"What is Hanes?\") ; if correct, they won the value of the question; if he/she was incorrect, failed to answer in time or phrase in the form of a question, that amount was deducted (hence, the dollar amount was \"always in jeopardy\") and his/her opponents could answer; having enough incorrect answers often led to negative scores. Thereafter, the contestant providing the last correct question selected next, and the process repeated; some answers made use of audio and/or video clues. Hidden behind one of the answers was a \"Daily Double\" space, with the contestant selecting that space able to wager up to all his/her current winnings or up to $500 if he/she had less) on the answer. After all 30 answers have been revealed (or sometimes, an undefined time limit expired), the game moved into \"Double Jeopardy!\" Gameplay was the same in \"Double Jeopardy!\" except six new categories were announced and the answers had values of $200 to $1,000 and two \"Daily Double\" spaces were hidden (with contestants able to wager up to $1,000 if they had less). At the end of the \"Double Jeopardy!\" round, all contestants with at least $1 were eligible to play \"Final Jeopardy!\"; however, anyone with $0 or a negative score was disqualified from further play. Trebek announced a category, and the contestants (before seeing the answer) wagered up to everything they had on their ability to answer. Contestants had 30 seconds to write what they believed was the correct question. Those who were correct had the amount they wagered added to their winnings; however, any incorrect questions or failing to phrase properly lost what they wagered. The contestant with the most cash was champion, kept his/her winnings and got to return the next day. Champions competed until they won five shows (at which point they retired undefeated and, starting in 1997, also won a new car) or until they were defeated. All five-time champions and other high-scoring contestants over a period of time participated in a Tournament of Champions, the winner earning an additional $100,000; there were also teen, college, senior and international tournaments and celebrity shows conducted (the winners of the non-celebrity tournaments also earned a spot in the Tournament of Champions). In the fall of 2001, several changes were made, including the use of a \"Clue Crew\" (new regulars illustrating answers in selected categories by going \"on location\"), and an increase in the dollar values of the answers (from $200 to $1,000 in Jeopardy! and $400 to $2,000 in Double Jeopardy!) ; another running change through the years was the addition of \"celebrity guests\" reading certain answers. None of the changes altered the basic game play, however.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"48 wins & 102 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmJjM2FhYTEtMjliYS00OThhLTk1NDgtNDYyNDJjNTNjY2NiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODg3NDc1OTE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.2/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"8.2","imdbVotes":"5,472","imdbID":"tt0159881","Type":"series","totalSeasons":"35","Response":"True"},"lastAnalysed":1590443877246},{"name":"Jericho (2016)","id":"433","omdb":{"Title":"Jericho","Year":"2006–2008","Rated":"TV-14","Released":"20 Sep 2006","Runtime":"45 min","Genre":"Action, Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi","Director":"N/A","Writer":"Stephen Chbosky, Josh Schaer, Jonathan E.

The now 10-year-old Henry is in desperate need of Emma's help because he believes from reading a book of fairytales that she's the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming - who sent her away from the Enchanted Forest to be protected from a curse that was enacted by the Evil Queen. Emma initially refuses to believe a word of Henry's story but soon finds that his hometown of Storybrooke, Maine is more than it seems. Because it's in Storybrooke that all of the classic characters we know are frozen in time with no memories of their former selves - except for the Evil Queen, who is Storybrooke's mayor and Henry's adoptive mother Regina Mills.

Resources are scarce and all crimes no matter their nature or severity are punishable by death (\"floating\") unless the perpetrator is under 18 years of age. After the Ark's life support systems are found to be critically failing, one hundred juvenile prisoners are declared \"expendable\" and sent to the surface in a last ditch attempt to determine if Earth is habitable again. The teens arrive on a beautiful planet they've only seen from space. Confronting the dangers of this rugged new world, they struggle to form a tentative community. However they discover that not all humanity was wiped out. There are people on Earth who survived the war, called \"grounders\" by the 100. The Ark consists of the space stations previously representing the nations of the UK, USA, Australia, Canada, China, Japan, India, Russia, Venezuela, France, Brazil, and Uganda.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"Nominated for 1 Primetime Emmy.

The tasks will test their intelligence, chutzpah and street-smarts. They will face the challenges of living in close quarters and must compete sometimes humorous but always difficult job assignments and will be forced to think outside the box in order to outshine each other to get to the top. Upon their arrival to New York City (some for the very first time), the 16 candidates will be rushed over to Trump Tower to meet with Donald Trump, the centerpiece and driving force of this series. After splitting the group into two teams of 8, Trump then issues the first task. Teams will be given time constraints for each task and they will be observed by either Trump himself or members of his staff at every moment along the way. At the conclusion of each task, the winning team will be granted a lavish reward but the losing team must report immediately to Trump's boardroom where one of them will be fired. Tasks each week will incorporate various aspects of business: sales, marketing, promotions, charities, real estate deals, finance, advertising pitches and facilities management. Most of them will be assignments that executives face in their daily lives. The big twist is that our teams are thrown out to the wolves of the New York business world with only a few days to complete incredibly difficult tasks, many of which have hundreds of thousands of dollars at stake. This is the ultimate corporate jungle where staying alive means using both street smarts and book smarts. The winner of the competition, the true \"apprentice\" will be granted the dream job of a lifetime with The Trump Organization and a salary of $250,000.","Language":"English","Country":"USA, UK","Awards":"Nominated for 9 Primetime Emmys.

And Pius XIII proves to be the most mysterious and contradictory of them all.

Separate stories concerning Kevin, Kate and Randall are also presented in their adult years, each who has his or her own baggage resulting from that upbringing: Kevin who was generally the neglected one because he had no outward issues; Kate who has always had weight issues; and Randall, the gifted one, being the visible outsider and being the \"non-K\" child. These stories may demonstrate the emotional ties that exist not only because of being family, but also because of four of them having the same birthday and some of them having always been together, meaning since conception.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"Won 1 Golden Globe.

In the 21st century, Jeff Tracy, a former astronaut, amasses a colossal fortune and decides that he must use it to benefit others. His answer to this desire is to create International Rescue, a unique private emergency response service equipped with customized designed vehicles and equipment that enable the organization to react to any crisis whether it be in sea, air, land, or space. Jeff's five sons volunteer to operate as the pilots and field agents, as well as \"Brains\" (real name unknown) who acts as the teams' technical developer and engineer. In addition, Jeff's friend, Kyrano and his daughter Tanusha aka Kayo (based on the original series Tin-Tin character) agree to be the support staff. In addition to the field team, IR also maintains an intelligence network with Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward and her ex-con chauffeur, Parker as the chief agents in this arm. The series depicts this team as they answer various calls for help around and beyond the world while they prevent enemies like the Hood, Uncle to Kayo, from learning and exploiting their secrets. We join the story when Jeff (and probably Kyrano) is missing - presumed dead - and his family are having to continue with his legacy still hoping he might be found safe. Kayo is now head of security and Grandma (who is a poor cook) is in charge of mealtimes!","Language":"English","Country":"UK, New Zealand","Awards":"2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2Q4Yjk3YzQtZWNlYi00MzdhLWJhMjgtNTYwNGY4YTU5YzIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjI4OTg2Njg@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.7/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.7","imdbVotes":"1,386","imdbID":"tt3138604","Type":"series","totalSeasons":"3","Response":"True"},"lastAnalysed":1590444516852},{"name":"Time After Time","id":"778","omdb":{"Title":"Time After Time","Year":"2017","Rated":"TV-14","Released":"05 Mar 2017","Runtime":"60 min","Genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi","Director":"N/A","Writer":"Kevin Williamson","Actors":"Freddie Stroma, Josh Bowman, Will Chase, Genesis Rodriguez","Plot":"The adventures of young H.G.

However, something that sounds so simple, is rarely so. Joined by two new team members, Caterina Boldieu, an ex- DGSE agent and later in the series, Jules Faroux, a computer and mechanical whizz, Frank is hired to deliver a diverse range of packages - from pop princesses to priceless paintings. Frank Martin takes the jobs no other transporter will touch or can achieve - simply because they are too challenging and the odds seemingly insurmountable. That is why he is considered the best transporter in the world. Frank's jobs take him to many beautiful locations around the world, but they also draw him into danger and mystery. And more often than not, solving that mystery will lead Frank to successfully completing his mission. However Frank's jobs aren't solely about the packages he must deliver but also about the people he meets. While his emphasis is always on completing the mission, Frank is unable to avoid the human emotions that come with dealing with clients in difficult situations - no matter how hard he tries. Transporter - The Series: Season 2 is an exciting, emotional, witting, adrenaline-fuelled twelve part series which will have the audience sitting on the edge of their seats as Frank drives them (sometimes quite literally!) through the twists and turns of each episode.","Language":"English","Country":"Canada, France, USA, Germany","Awards":"1 win & 2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0NjMxNjU3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDYyMjA1OQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.5/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.5","imdbVotes":"6,908","imdbID":"tt1885102","Type":"series","totalSeasons":"2","Response":"True"},"lastAnalysed":1590444538891},{"name":"Travelers","id":"668","omdb":{"Title":"Travelers","Year":"2016–2018","Rated":"TV-MA","Released":"23 Dec 2016","Runtime":"45 min","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Director":"N/A","Writer":"Brad Wright","Actors":"Eric McCormack, MacKenzie Porter, Nesta Cooper, Jared Abrahamson","Plot":"Hundreds of years from now, surviving humans discover how to send consciousness back through time, into people of the 21st century, while attempting to change the path of humanity.","Language":"English","Country":"Canada, USA","Awards":"4 wins & 15 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjUzOTQwOTg1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE4NzQ3NjM@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.1/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"8.1","imdbVotes":"41,147","imdbID":"tt5651844","Type":"series","totalSeasons":"3","Response":"True"},"lastAnalysed":1590444539865},{"name":"Treadstone","id":"1214","omdb":{"Title":"Treadstone","Year":"2019–","Rated":"TV-MA","Released":"15 Oct 2019","Runtime":"44 min","Genre":"Action","Director":"N/A","Writer":"Tim Kring","Actors":"Jeremy Irvine, Tracy Ifeachor, Omar Metwally, Hyo-joo Han","Plot":"The Treadstone project, having created super spy Jason Bourne, turns its attention on a new protocol to develop unstoppable superhuman assassins.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY5YWU4ZTEtNDUxZi00M2Q5LTg5YTEtN2YzNDc2ZTRmNjRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTE1NjY5Mg@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.0/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.0","imdbVotes":"5,969","imdbID":"tt8289480","Type":"series","totalSeasons":"1","Response":"True"},"lastAnalysed":1590444540891},{"name":"Treehouse Masters","id":"647","omdb":{"Title":"Treehouse Masters","Year":"2013–","Rated":"TV-PG","Released":"31 May 2013","Runtime":"42 min","Genre":"Comedy, Reality-TV","Director":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Actors":"Pete Nelson, Tory Jones, Christina Salway","Plot":"A man builds one-of-a-kind treehouses.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2MTE4NjMxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU2NjM2MDE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.3/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.3","imdbVotes":"1,142","imdbID":"tt2838492","Type":"series","totalSeasons":"11","Response":"True"},"lastAnalysed":1590444541867},{"name":"Trial & Error","id":"791","omdb":{"Title":"Trial","Year":"1971–","Rated":"N/A","Released":"26 Aug 1971","Runtime":"50 min","Genre":"Crime, Drama","Director":"N/A","Writer":"Martin Worth","Actors":"Godfrey James, Hector Ross, Barrie Cookson, Robert Harris","Plot":"Drama series depicting a murder trial.","Language":"English","Country":"UK","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"N/A","Ratings":[],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"N/A","imdbVotes":"N/A","imdbID":"tt0490758","Type":"series","totalSeasons":"1","Response":"True"},"lastAnalysed":1590444542893},{"name":"Tripped","id":"390","omdb":{"Title":"Tripped","Year":"2015","Rated":"N/A","Released":"08 Dec 2015","Runtime":"50 min","Genre":"Comedy, Sci-Fi","Director":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Actors":"Georgina Campbell, Jamie Demetriou, Richard Gadd, Blake Harrison","Plot":"Best friends Milo and Danny embark on a series of bizarre adventures across multiple, parallel universes.","Language":"English","Country":"UK","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTU4OGRiYWYtNTFlNS00MDU5LTk0ZjctOTFhZGY2NGY0MDQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjExMjk0ODk@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.6","imdbVotes":"1,051","imdbID":"tt4699514","Type":"series","totalSeasons":"1","Response":"True"},"lastAnalysed":1590444543892},{"name":"TripTank","id":"243","omdb":{"Title":"TripTank","Year":"2014–2016","Rated":"TV-MA","Released":"02 Apr 2014","Runtime":"N/A","Genre":"Animation, Comedy","Director":"N/A","Writer":"Matt Mariska, Andy Sipes, Sean Donnelly, Alessandro Minoli, Dana Snyder, Thomas O'Donnell, Mike Roberts, Josh Mecouch, Chris Osbrink, Daniel Katz, Peter Nelson, Rohitash Rao, Jeroom, Chris Weller, Felix Colgrave, Andy Herd, Will Hettinger, Matt Ferrucci, Andrew Racho, Chris Allison, Jacob Andrews, Kyle S.
